<h1>Fractal and Gulp Toolkit Tests</h1>

<h2>Production Tasks</h2>

<p>Run 'gulp' in your terminal to begin the following tests:</p>

<h3>Verifying Sass Complilation</h3>

<p><span class="test-sass">This text should be green</span> and <code>code</code> red, which confirms the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Sass in _tests.scss is getting compliled to CSS via import from main.scss.</li>
  <li>The Sass variables <code>$color-green</code> and <code>$color-darkred</code> are getting interpreted from the _variables.scss file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verifying Sass Linter</h3>

<p class="test-sass-lint">In the terminal, there should be the following two warnings:</p>

<pre>
  <samp>
  scss/_tests.scss
    12:3  warning  Expected `display`, found `cursor`  property-sort-order
    13:3  warning  Expected `cursor`, found `display`  property-sort-order

  ✖ 2 problems (0 errors, 2 warnings)
  </samp>
</pre>

<p>This CSS property sort order warning (intentional for this test) confirms that the gulp-sass-lint plugin is working.</p>

<h3>Verifying Modern Normalize CSS Module</h3>

<p>All text on this page should be styled using the system font, according to the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize/issues/3">Modern Normalize system font stack</a>. This confirms that the <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import">postcss-import</a> plugin is working.</p>

<h3>Verifying Autoprefixer's Basic Prefixing</h3>

<p class="test-autoprefixer-basic">This paragraph is styled with the <code>user-select</code> CSS property, which should create browser prefixes in the CSS. Inspect this paragraph via DevTools and confirm the appearance (usually crossed out) of <code>-webkit-</code> and other browser prefixes.</p> This will confirm that Autoprefixer is working.

<h3>Verifying SVG Injection into CSS</h3>

<p class="test-icon">A green "check" icon as a background image should appear here:</p>

<p>This confirms that the <a href="https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-svg">postcss-svg</a> plugin is working.</p>

<h3>Verifying Faker Library</h3>

<p><strong>Text generated by Faker should follow here:</strong> Ut facilis rerum quo est ut. Veniam velit beatae qui qui voluptatibus est voluptas. Commodi quo laboriosam quaerat incidunt temporibus odit est omnis. Odit voluptatum tempora incidunt dolorum voluptatem libero consectetur sint in.</p>

<h3>Verifying JavaScript Functionality</h3>

<p>Is JavaScript is getting copied from /js/ folder to /ui-assets/js folder and loading? (yes or no): <strong class="test-javascript">no</strong></p>

<p>In DevTools, confirm that the <code>body</code> tag has a class of <code>js-working</code>.</p>

<h3>Verifying JavaScript Linter (eslint)</h3>

<p>In the terminal, there should be the following two errors:</p>

<pre>
  <samp>
  /[user]/[path to repos]/cdlib-ui-kit/js/main.js
    3:40 error Extra semicolon
    5:20 error document.querySelector() is not supported in IE 8

  ✖ 2 problems (2 errors, 0 warnings)
    1 error and 0 warnings potentially fixable with the `--fix` option.
  </samp>
</pre>

<h3>Verifying JavaScript Compiler (babel)</h3>

<p>In /ui-assets/js/main.js, check that the ES2015 arrow function declared with the <code>const</code> variable <code>arrowFunctionTest</code> is getting compiled to the ES5 equivalent syntax. The variable should be declared as <code>var</code>.</p>

<h2>Build Tasks</h2>

<p>Run 'gulp build' in your terminal to begin the following tests:</p>

<h3>Verifying File Compilation</h3>

<p>Confirm that /dist/ is created at root. If already created from previous build, confirm that folder's existing build files get deleted before new build files are added. Check that all files in /dist/ contain the same "Date Modified" date/time as when 'gulp build' was run.</p>

<h3>Verifying Error Reporting</h3>

<p>Confirm that the same Sass and JavaScript errors presented from the 'Gulp' task above were also generated in the console for the build task.</p>

<h3>Verifying UI Library Build in Browser</h3>

<p>Open index.html in a browser. Confirm that the CDLIB UI Library's UI and content matches exactly that of the 'Gulp' task.</p>

<h3>Verifying Asset File Minification</h3>

<p>Confirm that /dist/ui-assets/css/main.css is minified without any sourcemaps.</p>

<p>Confirm that /dist/ui-assets/js/main.js is minified without any sourcemaps.</p>
